# 1 - MoSocket

Powerful. Flexible. Peer communication that works.

- Ever wanted two apps to talk to each other?
- Don't want to stand up centralized infrastructure?
- Tired of re-inventing the wheel on low-level socket logic?
- Want something powerful / flexible / that just works?

## 1.1 - What is it?

MoSocket is a socket abstraction designed around facilitating peer communication. That is, there is no inherent distinction between client and server. Every node could support the exact same interface, or each node could be wildly different from their neighbors. It's all up to you.
